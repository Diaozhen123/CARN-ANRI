# CARN-ANRI: AI & EEG-Based Piano Music for Emotional Regulation and Stress Reduction

## Introduction
Music, especially **piano music**, has a profound impact on human emotions and stress levels. While traditional therapeutic interventions aid in emotional regulation, they often **lack adaptability** and fail to integrate **personalized, real-time feedback**.

This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Electroencephalography (EEG)** to explore how piano music can enhance emotional regulation. We introduce two novel computational strategies:

1. **Cognitive Affective Regulatory Network (CARN)**:  
   - Uses **reinforcement learning** and **probabilistic modeling** to predict emotional states.  
   - Dynamically **adapts music-driven interventions** for optimal emotional balance.

2. **Adaptive Neural Regulation Integration (ANRI)**:  
   - Integrates **multimodal data** (EEG signals, self-reports, HRV, etc.).  
   - Refines emotional regulation strategies in **real-time** for personalized interventions.

### Why This Matters?
Traditional methods rely heavily on **self-reports** or isolated neurophysiological signals, often missing the **real-time complexity of emotions**. By combining EEG, AI, and **adaptive music feedback**, this approach enables **scalable, personalized stress management solutions** for digital mental health applications.
